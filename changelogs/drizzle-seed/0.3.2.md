## Bug fixes

- https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/3914

Both the `seed` and `reset` functions didn't include `LibSQLDatabase<any>` in their generic type parameters.
As a result, the `seed` function accepts a `db` parameter like this:

```ts
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/libsql";
import * as schema from "./schema.ts";

const db = drizzle({
  connection: {
    url: "",
    authToken: "",
  },
});

await seed(db, schema);
```

But it will reject a `db` parameter defined like this:

```ts
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/libsql";
import * as schema from "./schema.ts";

const db = drizzle({
  schema,
  connection: {
    url: "",
    authToken: "",
  },
});

await seed(db, schema);
```

drizzle-seed misinterpreted `realEstateTypeEnum` enum as a `real` type.
